			<h3>A Quick Update</h3>
			<h5>July 20, 2019</h5>

			<p>You might've noticed that there hasn't been a whole lot of activity since the last post. I've actually decided to shelf re-doing the website for a little bit as I've started focussing heavily on preparing for programming interviews. Ideally I'll begin working on the website again around later October but it is hard to say for sure. In the mean time however I started working on my own reference manual for popular coding challenges found on websites such as LeetCode, HackerRank, and the book Cracking the Coding Interview. The reference is by no means comprehensive and is primarily written in markdown. The link for it is above, feel free to check it out!</p>

			<h3>And begin!</h3>
			<h5>May 26, 2019</h5>

			<h4 class="firstSubtitle">An Introduction</h4>
			<p>What's up friends. This blog post begins a series of blog posts involving re-doing my personal website. The old website was statically typed, ugly, and to be honest just kind of bored me so I've decided to completely redo it from the ground up and take the opportunity to learn some interesting web technologies along the way. At the time of writing, this blog post is, and the website as a whole, are still statically typed in HTML and CSS. My intentions are to make a new website where I can add to the blog posts all from an online interface. This'll likely require some kind of database, admin interface (with login), and more! With each new feature or large step in development I'll be making one of these posts and talking about how everything's going. Lets begin!</p>
			
			<h4>The Toolset</h4>
			<p>A programmer is only as efficient as their toolkit (kind of). Beginning with package managers, something I'm only even mentionning because its a first for me on the Windows end of things. On MacOS I'm using the tried and true Homebrew. On Windows I'm using Chocolatey, a first for me. Now for the interesting stuff. I've decided to use React. I felt that the weight of a full framework like Angular was a bit unnecessary for the purpose of my personal website and trying to understand it would take up extra time whereas React is simply a library. Furthermore, I intend to learn and use SASS, SCSS in specific, since CSS seems to be a little bit repititious and using a pre-processor to save some time sounds dandy. Also I am going to be using SCSS rather than traditional SASS syntax since I'd like to have the ability to put pure CSS into the SASS script and don't care too much about a couple semicolons and brackets. We'll see how development goes. Since this is purely a personal project I'm really free to change, add, and remove and technologies as I please.</p>

			<h4>Progress Reports</h4>
			<p>So far all I've done was decide what technologies to use and whip up this placeholder site for the time being. Next up will be me toying around to get a grasp of how React and SASS work. Shouldn't take too long before whoever is reading this gets another nice blog post to look at. When the new site has reached a point where its worth taking a look at I'll throw another button at the top to check it out. Anyways, I'll end this post with a current look at the website. <a href="./progress_pics/progress_2019_05_26.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a>.</p>
